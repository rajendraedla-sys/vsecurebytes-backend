About Us
vSecurebytes is a cutting-edge cybersecurity and GenAI innovation company focused on building scalable, AI-driven applications across offensive security, defensive operations, and IT governance. Our mission is to empower organizations with locally hosted, privacy-first AI solutions that enhance security, visibility, and operational efficiency.

Founders
vSecurebytes was founded by Praveen Kumar, Raj Narra, and Bindu Sree—a team of cybersecurity and AI specialists with deep expertise in enterprise infrastructure, ethical hacking, and intelligent automation.

Our Journey
We began by integrating Generative AI into offensive security tooling—pioneering autonomous penetration testing and external attack surface monitoring powered by locally deployed AI models. These tools simulate real-world adversaries, delivering continuous threat discovery without compromising data privacy.

Our Vision
To become a central force in AI-powered cybersecurity—bridging automation, compliance, and intelligent decision-making. As threats evolve, we believe AI must be embedded natively within the organization’s infrastructure to provide real-time, contextual, and proactive security insights.

Our Expanding Capabilities
Building on our offensive security foundation, we are rapidly expanding into:

Internal AI Agents & Chatbots
Deploying secure, role-based AI chatbots trained on internal documentation and user profiles to support IT teams, developers, and end-users with automated, context-aware assistance.

Infrastructure Monitoring & Cost Intelligence
Enhancing traditional IT monitoring with AI-driven anomaly detection, predictive insights, and cloud-native cost optimization.

Governance & Compliance AI
Automating compliance checks, log analysis, and risk reporting using secure, locally hosted AI models aligned with internal policies and regulatory standards.

Our Approach

Local AI-First: All models are deployed privately, ensuring full data control and compliance.

Modular Design: Solutions plug into existing security and IT ecosystems with ease.

Scalable Architecture: Built to support growing enterprises with adaptable modules across red teaming, IT operations, and governance.
